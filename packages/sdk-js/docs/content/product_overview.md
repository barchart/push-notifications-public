**This SDK provides an API to interact to the _Barchart ENS_ â€” a simple tool for push notifications.**

You can _quickly_ build an application that allows your users to:

* Register a device to receive push notifications
* Unregister the device to stop receiving push notifications

## Supported Environments

This SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the Barchart ENS. We recommend using it in JavaScript environments.

#### Node.js

This SDK is compatible with Node.js.

#### Direct Access

The Barchart ENS implements a REST interface via HTTP. You may choose to interact with the remote service directly, bypassing this SDK entirely. An [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification of the interface can be found in the [API Reference](/content/api_reference) section.

#### Other

If JavaScript isn't suitable for your environment and you're not interested in direct access, please contact us at solutions@barchart.com or (866) 333-7587.
