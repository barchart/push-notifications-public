**This SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the _Barchart Push Notification Service._**

You can _quickly_ build an application that allows your applications to:

* Register a "device" for push notification delivery
* Unregister a "device" from push notification delivery

## Supported Environments

This SDK is written in JavaScript. Typically, this SDK will be embedded in mobile application (e.g. Android or iOS) which supports JavaScript. Alternately, this SDK could be used in a Node.js application.

#### Direct Access

The Barchart Push Notification Service implements a REST interface via HTTP. You may choose to interact with the remote service directly, bypassing this SDK entirely. An [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification of the interface can be found in the [API Reference](/content/api_reference) section.

#### Other

If JavaScript isn't suitable for your environment, and you're not interested in direct access, please contact us at solutions@barchart.com or (866) 333-7587.
