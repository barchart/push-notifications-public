## Purpose

Both Android and iOS devices allow alerts to be displayed on-screen when the affected application is inactive. Common examples include:

* A car from a ride-hailing service is approaching.
* Your friend uses a messaging app to send you a picture.

Typically, a remote event triggers the need to alert you. In the aforementioned cases:

* The ride-sharing company detects your car is nearby and wants to notify you.
* The messaging company receives a photo for you and wants to notify you.

The Barchart Push Notification Service facilitates these types of notifications by:

* Keeping a registry of mobile apps, the devices they installed on, and the users who are logged into those apps.
* Using information stored in registry to dispatch messages to the intended devices.
